# Plume Fullstack Developer Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the Plume Fullstack Developer Challenge!
In this challenge, you'll build a full-stack web application that allows users to connect their wallets and view both their Nest token balances and transaction history on the Plume blockchain.

This is your chance to showcase your ability to work across the stack, interact with blockchain data, and present it cleanly to users.

## Challenge Requirements

**Your application should allow users to:**
- ✅ Connect their crypto wallets (e.g., MetaMask).
- 📊 View their Nest token balance.
- 🧾 View a list of Nest token transactions, including:
  - Transaction hash
  - From/To addresses
  - Amount
  - Timestamp

**Bonus points for:**
- 🧪 Including tests (unit or integration)
- 🎨 Clean and responsive UI/UX
- 🚀 Performance optimizations (e.g., caching)
- 🔍 Filtering/searching transactions
- 📦 Deployment to a public URL (e.g., Vercel, Netlify)

## Expectations

We’re not looking for pixel-perfect design.

This is primarily a functionality-focused challenge. The goal is to understand how you structure fullstack apps, interact with blockchain data, and present it clearly.

Use your time however you like, but if you want a guideline:

> ⏱️ Expected time: 2–4 hours
> Feel free to take longer if you'd like to go deeper or polish your work.

## Submission Instructions
1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Build your solution within the forked repo.
3. When you're done, open a Pull Request to this repo.
4. In your PR description, include:
   - A brief overview of your approach
   - Any tradeoffs, known limitations, or assumptions
   - A link to your deployed app (if available)

# Design
To make this easier, we’ve included a basic design mockup you can follow:
👉 View the mockup [here](https://www.figma.com/design/oBoNbs3O3j7zazji3w0V9c/Nest-Lite?node-id=0-1&t=nF8fMDHfINHWt95s-1)

You’re free to adapt the layout as needed — this is just a starting point.

## FAQs

**❓ What is the Plume blockchain?**

The Plume blockchain is a decentralized, EVM-compatible platform optimized for real-world asset (RWA) applications. [Learn more](https://docs.plume.org/)

**❓ What is Nest?**

Nest is an RWA protocol built on Plume. It enables users to deposit stablecoins into on-chain vaults and earn yield backed by tokenized real-world assets. [Learn more](https://docs.nest.credit/)

**❓ What is an ERC-20 token?**

ERC-20 is the standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum and compatible chains like Plume. It defines how tokens can be transferred and how balances are tracked.

**❓ How much time should I spend on this?**

We estimate this should take around 2–4 hours to complete, but you’re welcome to take more time to polish or go deeper.
